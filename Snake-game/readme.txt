A lightweight Unix-like shell implemented in C that supports internal commands, external commands, piping, and I/O redirection. 
This project strengthened my understanding of process creation, system calls (fork, execvp, pipe, dup2), and command parsing.
It replicates essential shell behaviors while demonstrating OS concepts like inter-process communication and file descriptor management.
