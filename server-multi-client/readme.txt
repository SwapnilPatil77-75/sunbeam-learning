This project implements a multithreaded TCP server capable of handling multiple client connections simultaneously using POSIX threads. 
Each client can interact with the server to perform file-system operations such as listing files, uploading files, downloading files, 
creating directories, and deleting files inside a managed server directory. 
The server supports recursive directory listing, safe concurrent access, and cleanly handles client disconnections. 
This project demonstrates practical use of sockets, TCP networking, multithreading, file handling, and directory traversal in C.
