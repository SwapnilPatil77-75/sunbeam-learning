A lightweight Unix-like shell implemented in C that supports internal commands, external commands, piping, and I/O redirection.
This project strengthened my understanding of process creation, system calls (fork, execvp, pipe, dup2), and command parsing. 
It replicates essential shell behaviors while demonstrating OS concepts like inter-process communication and file descriptor management.

A lightweight command-line shell implemented in C to understand how Linux handles processes internally.
Features:
- Command parsing
- fork(), exec() based process creation
- I/O redirection (>, <)
- Pipelining using pipe()
- Basic built-in command handling

This project strengthened my understanding of process control, system calls, and Linux internals.
